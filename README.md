# Global_Immigrant_Flow_Viz

I created this project on a team of two people in the Spring of 2021 for the course INFO 3330: Data Driven Web Applications. The website leverages d3.js and allows users to interactively explore global immigration patterns over time.
On this project, I was primarily responsible for the map visualization and related filtering elements.
